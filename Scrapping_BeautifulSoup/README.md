# first.py
##### **Python Version : Python3**

The Script is used for scraping the results from KNIT, Sultanpur site using BeautifulSoup & urllib. You have to provide the link for the result available on the college site **knit.ac.in**.

Pretty much everything is hardcoded. Do change the range for Roll Numbers and the link for result. Results are stored in  "Result.csv" file in an unsorted manner.

* Tried using User Input for URL but a bug in PyCharm  Prohibits to take URL Input.
* Any improvements are welcome.
